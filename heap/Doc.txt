1. Array Representation of Binary Tree :

If a node is at index i,
its left child is at - 2*i
its right child is at - 2*i+1
its parent is at i/2

2. Complete Binary Tree and Full Binary Tree

A Full Binary Tree has all levels completely filled.
In a Full Binary Tree, no. of nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1
NOTE: height of root node = 0

A Complete Binary Tree has all levels completely filled except possibly the last, where all nodes are filled from left to right.

3. Max Heap vs Min Heap
Min Heap:
    Every parent node ≤ its children
    means the smallest element is always at the root.
Max Heap:
    Every parent node >= its children
    means the largest element is always at the root.

Lets discuss Max Heap:
Insertion: always happens from the Last Node
    Here adjustment is done from Leaf to Root
    1. Delete Last Node
    2. Do adjustment

Deletion: We can delete only root node (min/max element)
    Here adjustment is done from Root to Leaf
    1. Delete root
    2. Place last element to root
    3. Do adjustment

4. Heap Sort
    When we delete the root node from a Heap, we place the deleted element at the last available index of the array.
    By performing delete operation n times, the resulting array will be sorted.
    Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))

5. Heapify
    Process of creating a Heap, Operation used to restore the heap property.
    Time Complexity: O(n)
